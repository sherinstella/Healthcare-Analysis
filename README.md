PROJECT OVERVIEW:<br>

This project demonstrates end-to-end healthcare data analysis — from data cleaning in Python (Pandas) to interactive visualization in Excel.
The goal was to extract key business insights like billing trends, patient distribution, and top medical conditions through clean and visually appealing dashboards.<br>

Key Steps:<br>
Raw healthcare data was cleaned using Python before importing into Excel.<br>
Handled missing and null values<br>
Removed duplicates and invalid records<br>
Standardized date formats for admission and discharge<br>
Created a new column for billing vs. refund transactions<br>
Converted data types (numeric, date, categorical) properly<br>

Visualization:<br>
Pie Chart : Blood Type Distribution<br>
Bar Chart : Top Medical Conditions<br>
Horizontal Bar :Top Medications<br>
Line Chart : Age Distribution<br>
Pie Chart : Billings by Admission Type<br>
KPI Cards : Total Billing, Refund, No. of Patients<br>

Slicers Added For:<br>
Gender<br>
Hospital<br>
Doctor<br>
Medical Condition<br>
Insurance Provider<br>
